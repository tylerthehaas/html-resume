                  <b>Background: </b>Our Yearbook product was originally
                  designed so that we would send an email to an employees
                  manager upon their work anniversary. The manager would then
                  select individuals to comment in their yearbook and invite
                  them to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solution: </b>I implemented a more automated solution that
                  would analyze each companies organization and automatically
                  send an email invite to those individuals that are a part of
                  the individuals team as part of a nightly batch job. This was
                  very well received by our clients as it took a lot of the
                  manual work off of the managers within our clients
                  organizations.

                <li>
                  <b>Background: </b>Monsanto was in need of some software that
                  allowed the growers within their research and development team
                  to record their research trial results and present them to
                  stake holders within a product advancement meeting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solution: </b>Our team created an application built on
                  React/Redux, Node.js and PostgreSQL that filled this need. It
                  was centered around data analysis that would recommend an
                  advancement decision. Another key feature we built was the
                  ability to upload excel files and have the data uploaded be
                  presented in various different data visualizations that we
                  presented through the User Interface.

                  <b>Background: </b>Our business was built around allowing our
                  clients to conduct different incentive programs to promote a
                  certain outcome for their business. Each incentive program had
                  to go through custom development which was very expensive from
                  a program setup perspective.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solution: </b>I built an application on top of the Angular
                  Framework that guided the user through the process of creating
                  a new incentive program. This allowed us to greatly decrease
                  the setup cost of a new program increasing the number of sales
                  we were able to close with our clients.
