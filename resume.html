                  <b>Background: </b>Our Yearbook product was originally 
                  designed so that we would send an email to an employees 
                  manager upon their work anniversary. The manager would then 
                  select individuals to comment in their yearbook and invite 
                  them to do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solution: </b>I implemented a more automated solution that
                  would analyze each companies organization and automatically 
                  send an email invite to those individuals that are a part of 
                  the individuals team as part of a nightly batch job. This was
                  very well received by our clients as it took a lot of the 
                  manual work off of the managers within our clients
                  organizations.

                  <b>Background: </b>Monsanto was in need of some software that 
                  allowed the growers within their research and development team
                  to record their research trial results and present them to
                  stake holders within a product advancement meeting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solution: </b>Our team created an application built on 
                  React/Redux, Node.js and PostgreSQL that filled this need.
                  It was centered around data analysis that would recommend an
                  advancement decision. Another key feature we built was the
                  ability to upload excel files and have the data uploaded be
                  presented in various different data visualizations that
                  we presented through the User Interface.

                  <b>Background: </b>Our business was built around allowing
                  our clients to conduct different incentive programs to
                  promote a certain outcome for their business. Each incentive
                  program had to go through custom development which was very 
                  expensive from a program setup perspective.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solution: </b>I built an application on top of the Angular
                  Framework that guided the user through the process of creating
                  a new incentive program. This allowed us to greatly decrease 
                  the setup cost of a new program increasing the number of sales 
                  we were able to close with our clients.
